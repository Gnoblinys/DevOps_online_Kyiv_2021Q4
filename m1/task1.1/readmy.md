It isn't my first expiriense with Git but first when i use git according to git idea.

When i have started do homework, i faced with some different documents - there was txt with any commands, pdf with homework> pdf with tutorial... I oppened a lot off window on my PC, it was terrible and not convenient. My two monitors wasn't enough.
I remembed about VScode there i edited some code. It's excelent tools for work with big volume of data and files.
