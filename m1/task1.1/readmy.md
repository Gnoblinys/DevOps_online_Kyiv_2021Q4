# **Hello in my first task1.1** #

It wasn't my first expiriense with Git but it was first time when i use git according to the idea of this one.

When I have started doing the homework, I faced with some different documents. There was txt with some commands, pdf with homework, pdf with tutorial... I oppened a lot of windows on my PC, it was terrible and not comfortble. My two monitors wasn't enough. (It weren't enought to use my two monitors)
I remembed about VScode becouse there I had edited some code before. It's an excelent tool for work with big a volume of data and files.
